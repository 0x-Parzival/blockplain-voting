# 🗳️ Voting Blockplain

A futuristic, interactive web-based voting system inspired by blockchain visualization. This project demonstrates how user interactions (like voting or adding a region) are visualized as "blocks" within a dynamic "blockplain" — mimicking blockchain structure in a visually intuitive way.

## 🔮 Features

- ✅ **Voting System** – Users can vote for option A or B.
- 🗺️ **Region Management** – Add and manage custom voting regions.
- 🧱 **Block Visualization** – Every action is reflected visually:
  - **Horizontal Blocks** = Region additions
  - **Vertical Blocks** = Vote submissions
- 🌈 **Neon Black Theme** – Sleek and modern UI using dark mode + neon highlights.
- 🧠 **Live Simulation** – Watch how the blockplain evolves in real-time.
- 🎨 **Random Hex Color Hover** – Hover on blocks to reveal random hex color codes.
- 📊 **Vote Tracking** – Keeps count of total votes for A and B.
